The following code is to help you play with Numpy, which is a library
that provides functions that are especially useful when you have to
work with large arrays and matrices of numeric data, like doing
matrix matrix multiplications. Also, Numpy is battle tested and
optimized so that it runs fast, much faster than if you were working
with Python lists directly.
'''

'''
The array object class is the foundation of Numpy, and Numpy arrays are like
lists in Python, except that every thing inside an array must be of the
same type, like int or float.

other mathematical operations that you can apply to Numpy arrays, such as
mean and dot product.

Both of these functions will be useful in later programming quizzes.

The following code is to help you play with the concept of Series in Pandas.

You can think of Series as an one-dimensional object that is similar to
an array, list, or column in a database. By default, it will assign an
index label to each item in the Series ranging from 0 to N, where N is
the number of items in the Series minus one.

Please feel free to play around with the concept of Series and see what it does

'''############################Creating a data frame #################################################'''

'''
The following code is to help you play with the concept of Data frame in Pandas.

You can think of a Data frame as something with rows and columns. It is
similar to a spreadsheet, a database table, or R's data.frame object.

*This playground is inspired by Greg Reda's post on Intro to Pandas Data Structures:
http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/
'''

'''
To create a data frame, you can pass a dictionary of lists to the Data frame
constructor:
1) The key of the dictionary will be the column name
2) The associating list will be the values within that column.
'''
# Change False to True to see Data frames in action

'''
Pandas also has various functions that will help you understand some basic
information about your data frame. Some of these functions are:
1) dtypes: to get the data type for each column
2) describe: useful for seeing basic statistics of the data frame's numerical
   columns
3) head: displays the first five rows of the data set
4) tail: displays the last five rows of the data set

'''
You can think of a DataFrame as a group of Series that share an index.
This makes it easy to select specific columns that you want from the
DataFrame.

Also a couple pointers:
1) Selecting a single column from the DataFrame will return a Series
2) Selecting multiple columns from the DataFrame will return a DataFrame
